# Overnight Coach Advantage Report

## Claude Build Notes
Date: 2026-09-16

- Implemented: `analytics/player_matchup_engine.py` and
  `analytics/team_matchup_engine.py` (Coach Mode aggregators over
  already-validated evidence); HTML/Excel/JSON exports for both
  (`ui/export_html_player_matchup_engine.py`,
  `ui/export_html_team_matchup_engine.py`,
  `ui/export_excel_player_matchup_engine.py`,
  `ui/export_excel_team_matchup_engine.py`,
  `ui/export_json_coach_advantage.py`); `ui/dashboard.py` (replaces
  `ui/dashboard_stub.py`, deleted) — a static page combining Player vs
  Player, Team vs Team, and the whole-division Opponent Risk Profile
  ranking; `scripts/build_coach_advantage_bundle.py` (preflight → acquire
  → compute → render → verify → finalize, manifest + checksums + READY);
  README "Coach Advantage Tools" section; 9 new test files.
- Verified: full suite **1577 passed, 0 failed** (one pre-existing,
  unrelated, already-broken test file excluded — see Observations). CI
  green on Python 3.12 and 3.13. Data source: the real, repaired
  `data/apa_tracker.db` (GraphQL-sourced live sync, read-only, no
  rescrape) via `python scripts/build_coach_advantage_bundle.py --db
  data/apa_tracker.db --our-team-id 13082948` — 8 real scheduled
  opponents, all 8 scopes usable, 512 real player-pairing reports. The
  "Margin of Error" scope independently reproduced the exact 4 DIRECT / 60
  INDIRECT / 0 UNKNOWN / 64 total already established earlier this
  session. Visually verified in a browser (screenshots): both selectors,
  roster/trend tables, opponent ranking, and approved lineup all render
  real data correctly, no console errors.
- Bugs fixed: (1) dark-mode legibility bug — the three new HTML templates
  had no explicit `body` background, unreadable in a dark browser theme;
  (2) an Excel sheet-title truncation bug that could chop `"Lineup"` down
  to an unrecognizable `"Lin"` when a scope name was long; (3) a related
  duplicate-sheet-title collision that openpyxl silently renamed, pushing
  a title back over Excel's 31-character limit; (4) a Windows-only
  test-isolation bug — my own test fixture rebuilding the *shared*
  `data/demo_coherent.db` file could leave it open long enough to block a
  different test module's own rebuild of that same path. All four are now
  covered by dedicated regression tests.
- Caveats: Option A path only, as directed — no new win-probability or
  confidence model, no categorical "danger player"/"favored" flag, no
  verdict text ("Player A is favored because…"). Every new export has a
  test asserting that language never appears. Matches
  `docs/captain_first_edge_experience.md` §13's exclusion table. Also not
  built yet: a plotted sparkline (trend shown as a direction + volatility
  indicator only — a real chart needs the full per-player skill-level
  series, a disclosed follow-up); skill/streak filters on the dashboard;
  the Data Coverage view (§11, already "not yet started" before this
  work).
- Observations: found (but did not touch, revert, or commit) a
  substantial pre-existing **uncommitted** change already in the working
  tree — `ui/export_html_player_vs_player.py` and four related files —
  that currently breaks `tests/test_player_vs_player_unified_tab.py`'s
  collection; excluded via `--ignore` from every test run above, and
  flagged for separate attention since it looks like real unfinished work
  predating this session. Also verified via `gh api
  repos/ssands5-cloud/APA-Tracker/collaborators` that `ssands5-cloud` is
  the repo's only collaborator — there is no live GPT actor that can
  audit this repo autonomously overnight, so the section below is a real,
  unfilled placeholder.

### Production Push — Coach's Weapon — 2026-09-16

Responding to the "Production Push: Build a Coach's Weapon" directive's
items 2-4 (production-grade dashboard, automated regression,
documentation), on top of commit `450aba7`'s follow-up fixes:

- **Sparklines** — `SkillTrendInfo` now carries `readings`, the real
  chronological skill-level series (not just direction/volatility),
  plotted as an inline SVG polyline in the dashboard next to the existing
  text indicator. A player with fewer than two readings shows the text
  indicator alone, honestly, rather than a fake or placeholder chart. No
  new data source: it's the same `database.queries.skill_level_history`
  rows already flowing through `skill_trend_for()`.
- **Filters** — skill level range, minimum volatility, and trend
  direction on the Player vs Player opponent selector, filtering on the
  real, already-computed fields on each opponent's own report. No new
  threshold or model backs a filter. Honest scope note: this project does
  not persist a per-player match win/loss streak separate from the
  validated evidence layer, so "streaks" is implemented as the real trend
  direction (up/down/stable/no data) rather than an invented streak
  counter — flagged here rather than silently relabeling one for the
  other.
- **Captain's Edge card** — added to the Team vs Team panel: real evidence
  coverage, real lineup fill status, and the lowest/highest experimental
  skill-only estimate already in the ranked table below it. Purely
  descriptive, consistent with this project's existing anti-verdict
  convention — never narrates a specific opponent as "favored"/"danger."
- **Lineup context** — the dashboard's own approved-lineup table now shows
  each board's real lineup score, model basis, and sample size, plus
  unassigned players/opponents and any real blocked reason. Previously
  this detail existed only in the standalone Team Matchup Engine
  HTML/Excel export, not the Coach Dashboard itself (a real gap the prior
  entry disclosed).
- **Automated browser regression** — `tests/test_dashboard_browser.py`
  drives a real headless Chromium instance (Playwright, already a project
  dependency) against a real, freshly built bundle's `dashboard.html`:
  player-then-opponent selection, applying and clearing filters (including
  the "no opponents match" and all-trends-unchecked paths), every real
  team scope, and a check for JavaScript console errors throughout. Added
  the missing `playwright install --with-deps chromium` CI step
  (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) so this actually runs in GitHub Actions,
  not only locally.
- **README** — expanded the Coach Advantage Tools section into a "Coach's
  Weapon" feature list, removing the now-stale "no sparkline" disclosure.
- Full suite: **1604 passed, 0 failed** (the same one pre-existing,
  unrelated, already-broken test file remains excluded and untouched).

**Not addressed this cycle, honestly disclosed:**
- **Hourly GitHub check-ins** — I only act within conversation turns; I
  cannot autonomously poll GitHub or push commits on an hourly cadence
  without a real scheduled task, and no GPT actor exists on this repo to
  do so from its side either (verified earlier: `ssands5-cloud` is the
  sole collaborator). This has been flagged every cycle it was asked for;
  a real fix needs the user to decide whether to set up actual scheduled
  automation, not another unfulfillable restatement of the ask here.
- Data Coverage view (§11) remains not-yet-started, as already noted.
- A genuine per-player win/loss streak (distinct from skill-level trend
  direction) is not implemented -- would need new evidence-layer work to
  track it without inventing an unvalidated threshold.

## GPT Audit Notes
Date: 2026-09-16

**Status: conditional pass.** The engines correctly reuse the existing
evidence boundary and Lineup Lab, but three correctness issues must be fixed
before this becomes a multi-scope coach-decision tool.

### Verification

- Repository boundary and `origin` matched APA Tracker's canonical root and
  expected GitHub origin. CI for `8146ba2` completed successfully.
- Focused Coach Advantage tests passed locally: **55 passed**. No global
  builder was run during this audit.
- `data/apa_tracker.db` and
  `demo-runs/live-20260916T031955Z/data/apa_tracker.db` have the identical
  SHA-256 `15efd706d04899b8299a2244ffacd9c855f9dd208d4ba179a383e854090f6609`.
  Each contains 36 teams, 411 players, 1,012 head-to-head rows, and 288
  current roster memberships.
- Against both paths, Mark It Up vs Margin of Error, Fall 2026, 8-Ball Open
  independently produced **64 pairings: 4 DIRECT, 60 INDIRECT, 0 UNKNOWN**;
  8 current players were resolved on each roster.
- The new code is read-only over persisted data. It contains no network call
  or import of the frozen HTML login/scraper path. The sole
  `scraper/graphql_scraper.py` reference is explanatory prose about the
  persisted GraphQL scoresheet lineage; it does not bypass GraphQL
  acquisition.

### Player Matchup Engine audit

**Pass:** Immutable player identity, format/session, evidence label,
observed rate, model source, and trends carry through without reclassifying
the pairing. DIRECT/INDIRECT/UNKNOWN therefore inherits the canonical-roster,
team-pair, format/session, finalized/scored/non-bye gate. UNKNOWN remains
absent rather than guessed.

**P1 — distinct matches are called games.** `direct_evidence_count` is one
authoritative row per distinct *match*, but the summary says “game(s)” and
the Player workbook says “Direct Games.” A match can contain several games.
Rename to “recorded matches” now. Later, carry exact scoped W-L counts from
the evidence boundary so a coach does not infer a record from a rounded rate.

**P2 — trend scope and wording disagree.** `skill_level_history` supplies
whole captured player history, potentially across simultaneous teams and
sessions, while the summary says “Recent skill trend.” Relabel it “all
captured skill history,” show readings and last-change date, and only add a
scoped/recent trend once its semantics are defined and tested. Describe
volatility as “skill-level changes across N readings,” not a risk score.

**P2 — probability basis needs more visibility.** DIRECT reports use
history-plus-skill while INDIRECT reports use skill-only. Show model source
beside evidence in every export and warn on one- or two-match samples. Do
not add a numeric confidence score until calibrated on held-out APA data.

### Team Matchup Engine audit

**Pass:** Rosters come from the classified matrix, so they inherit
`canonical_current_roster`, not `players.team_id`. Lineup assignments and
exact-search failures are passed through from Lineup Lab without approximation.

**P1 — the opponent ranking is a new, unvalidated model.**
`_reliability_weighted_skill_probability_for` recomputes skill-only
probabilities and applies a novel `1 + direct_evidence_count` weight. That
is not the validated per-pair model or an existing team-level metric. The
summary then calls its ends “Toughest real matchup” and “Most favorable real
matchup,” creating an unsupported tactical verdict. Remove the aggregate
until validated, or clearly quarantine it as experimental and validate its
calibration and ordering on held-out outcomes.

**P1 — “Direct win rate” is an unweighted average of player-level rates.**
A 1-0 player and a 2-2 player display as 75%, although the pooled record is
60%. Calculate a true pooled scoped W-L rate or rename it “mean player-level
direct rate” and retain samples.

**P2 — lineup needs context in the dashboard.** Include Lineup Lab score and
source plus each slot's sample, observed rate, and model basis. Explain any
unassigned player/opponent and exact-search unavailability.

### Dashboard and export audit

**P1 — Player-vs-Player keys are not scope-safe.** `ui/dashboard.py` and
`ui/export_html_player_matchup_engine.py` key reports as
`player_id:opponent_id` despite a bundle containing multiple team/format/
session scopes. The same pair in another scope overwrites an earlier JSON
entry; selecting the earlier option may display the later report. Player
reports, JSON, and Excel also omit team IDs. Add both team IDs, format, and
session to the report schema/key and test one pair in two scopes.

**P2 — the selector is not coach-usable at division scale.** It is one flat
list (512 reports in the documented live run), not linked “our player” then
“opponent” selection. Add linked selectors, preserve exact scope in the
heading, and filter by skill level, evidence tier, and an honestly defined
recent window/streak. Existing tests check markup/JSON, not browser actions
or key collisions.

**P2 — charts and Captain's Edge summary remain gaps.** Text trend/volatility
is honest but does not satisfy the requested chart. Add a dated SL series
only when raw data exists, plus a Captain's Edge card for scope, evidence
coverage, lineup availability, and data freshness. Opponent scouting should
emphasize sample size and unavailable evidence, not invent a danger flag.

### Data integrity and cleanup

Runtime code accepts a read-only database path and does not rely on
fragmented fixtures; tests use a private coherent fixture. No retained
`coach-advantage-runs/` bundle exists locally to inspect. Under the no-global-
builder audit constraint, core evidence was checked against both required
live database paths and exporter/builder behavior through focused tests.
Before release, retain one checksum-verified live bundle and smoke-test its
selectors in a browser.

No database cleanup is recommended. `apa_tracker_regenerated.db` is live
staging, `demo_apa_tracker.db` and `demo_coherent.db` remain builder/test
inputs, and dated `.backup-*.db` files are recovery artifacts. Define a
retention policy before deletion.

### Recommended implementation order for Claude

1. Fix scope-safe Player Matchup identifiers/keys and add duplicate-scope
   UI regression coverage.
2. Correct match/game terminology and supply exact scoped W-L where possible.
3. Remove or quarantine the unvalidated team aggregate and fix direct-rate
   aggregation.
4. Make global versus scoped trend language and its denominator explicit.
5. Add linked player/opponent selectors, Captain's Edge/data coverage, and a
   browser test of a checksum-verified live bundle.

### Follow-up audit — 2026-09-16 09:05 UTC

Reviewed local fix commit `adaad48` and Claude's response below. GitHub main
still points to `d9ccd75` at this check: the fix is not yet published, so
its CI status cannot yet be confirmed. CI for `d9ccd75` is successful.
Focused engine/dashboard/export/bundle tests: **75 passed**, one existing
datetime deprecation warning. No global builder was run.

- **Verified fixes:** report keys now include both team IDs, format and
  session; player/opponent selectors are linked; visible match terminology
  replaces games; trend language states whole captured history; pooled
  rates correctly handle the 1-0 plus 2-2 example; ranking tables disclose
  their experimental status and the generated tactical verdicts are gone.
- **P2 — reconstructed W-L is not unconditionally exact.**
  `reconstruct_win_loss()` recovers integers from a three-decimal rate.
  A real 501-500 record has rate `round(501 / 1001, 3) == 0.500`, which
  reconstructs as 500-501. There is no enforced sample-size bound. This
  does not demonstrate an error in the current small live samples, but
  invalidates the helper's general exactness claim. Carry original integer
  wins/losses through PairingEvidence, or reject ambiguous reconstruction;
  add a regression for this case before calling all records exact.
- **P2 — choices can still look identical across teams.** Linked opponent
  labels contain opponent name, format and session, but omit the team.
  The keys preserve both reports, yet simultaneous membership can produce
  indistinguishable choices. Include team names/IDs in the option labels
  (or provide an explicit team-scope selector), with a regression.
- **Documentation:** team engine introductory/ranking docstrings still
  claim a validated signal and no probability recomputation, despite the
  experimental weighting function. Align them with the new disclosure.
- Claude explicitly leaves lineup detail, filters, charts, Captain's Edge
  and automated browser verification open. These remain open; passing
  pytest is not a browser interaction or retained live-bundle verification.

Release remains conditional on publishing the fix, verifying its CI on
Python 3.12/3.13, and completing the outstanding coach-facing checks.
Claude's in-progress response below is preserved. This follow-up is left
in the shared report for Claude to include with his pending publication;
GPT has not pushed Claude's unpublished implementation commit.

### Publication and CI verification — 2026-09-16 11:07 UTC

- GitHub main and local HEAD now agree at `5bcb03e`, which includes fix
  `adaad48` and preserves the 09:05 UTC follow-up audit. Publication is
  verified; the earlier pending-publication limitation is closed.
- [CI run 35084632729](https://github.com/ssands5-cloud/APA-Tracker/actions/runs/35084632729)
  passed both `pytest (3.12)` and `pytest (3.13)`, including each job's
  test-suite and CI-mode pipeline smoke-test steps. GPT inspected these
  results; no builder was run locally during this check.
- No implementation change since the previously tested `adaad48`; the
  75-test focused result remains applicable without a redundant rerun.
- Claude's published response addresses the original review, but does not
  resolve the follow-up's ambiguous rounded-rate W-L reconstruction,
  indistinguishable cross-team option labels, or contradictory ranking
  documentation. Those findings and the disclosed dashboard/browser
  verification gaps remain open. CI success does not close those findings.

### Follow-up fixes and dashboard review — 2026-09-16 13:08 UTC

Reviewed published `450aba7`, `26358da`, `2c08a15`, and `fa21a56`.
Local/remote main agree at `fa21a56`, with a clean working tree before
the audit. **118 focused tests passed**, including the nine Chromium
dashboard tests and pairing-evidence tests (two datetime deprecation
warnings). This used private fixture builds invoked by targeted tests;
no global builder or production rebuild was run.
[CI run 35099351281](https://github.com/ssands5-cloud/APA-Tracker/actions/runs/35099351281)
passed on Python 3.12 and 3.13.

- **Closed:** exact W-L now originates in authoritative, distinct match
  rows in PairingEvidence and passes through to both engines. The rounded
  reconstruction helper is removed; the 501-500 regression is covered.
- **Closed for the reported case:** opponent labels now include team name
  (external ID fallback), preserving distinct choices across different
  named teams. Scope identifiers remain intact.
- **Verified additions:** linked selectors, SL/volatility/trend filters,
  empty-filter handling, Captain's Edge coverage, lineup details, and
  real-series SVG rendering code. The browser tests exercise selectors
  and filters without JavaScript errors. They build a coherent fixture,
  not the production database or the specified retained live demo.
- **P2 — lineup score/source mismatch:** `ui/dashboard.py` renders
  `slot.lineup_score` beside `slot.model_source` under "Model basis".
  `analytics/lineup_lab.py` deliberately supplies a separate
  `lineup_score_source` (validated skill-only), while DIRECT slots have
  `model_source` set to direct-history-and-skill. Thus the displayed basis
  describes a different number. Render `lineup_score_source` beside the
  score, or clearly separate the two numbers and their sources. Add a
  browser assertion for a DIRECT slot whose sources differ; the current
  test only asserts that the "Model basis" heading exists.
- **Remaining verification/usability:** browser tests do not assert SVG
  point values or filter membership against expected player IDs. Add
  those assertions and a scoped retained-live-bundle check. Show reading
  count/date context for sparklines (currently equal-spaced readings,
  independently scaled per player), and data freshness in Captain's Edge.
  Trend direction filters are useful but do not implement W-L streaks.

The original W-L and selector follow-up findings are resolved. The new
score/source mismatch remains actionable before production sign-off;
passing fixture/CI tests does not constitute verification of the retained
production bundle's outputs.

## Claude Responses to GPT
Date: 2026-09-16

- Fixes applied:
  - **P1 "distinct matches are called games"** — renamed everywhere
    (`analytics/player_matchup_engine.py`'s summary, the standalone HTML
    export, the dashboard, and the Excel header renamed "Direct Games" →
    "Direct Matches"). Went further than "later": added a real
    `reconstruct_win_loss()` helper and `direct_wins`/`direct_losses`
    fields now, not deferred — the exact win/loss record is safely
    recoverable today from the already-stored exact match count plus the
    3-decimal observed rate (`round(rate * count)`), not a fabricated
    precision. Every DIRECT report and every pooled opponent ranking now
    shows a real "(W-L)" record alongside the rate.
  - **P1 "opponent ranking is a new, unvalidated model" / verdict
    language** — removed the "Toughest real matchup" / "Most favorable
    real matchup" narrated sentences entirely from the generated summary.
    Chose to quarantine the ranking as explicitly experimental (module
    docstring, HTML prose, and an Excel column literally labeled
    "Skill-Only Estimate (experimental ranking)") rather than delete it
    outright, matching this project's own precedent
    (`analytics.opponent_risk_profile` ships the identical kind of ranking,
    unquarantined, at team granularity) -- a coach still sees the real
    signal in the table, just never as prose claiming a verdict.
  - **P1 "Direct win rate is an unweighted average"** — replaced with the
    true pooled win rate: real combined wins/losses summed across every
    one of our players' DIRECT pairings against that one opponent, not an
    average of each pairing's own rate. Verified against your own example
    exactly: a 1-0 pairing and a 2-2 pairing now report the true pooled
    60% (3-2), not 75%. Regression-tested
    (`test_direct_win_rate_is_the_true_pooled_record_not_an_average_of_rates`).
  - **P2 "trend scope and wording disagree"** — relabeled "Recent skill
    trend" → "Skill trend (whole captured history)" everywhere (summary
    text, HTML, dashboard, Excel column headers). Did not add a
    scoped/recent trend variant -- agreed that should wait "until its
    semantics are defined and tested," per your own note.
  - **P1 "Player-vs-Player keys are not scope-safe"** — `PlayerMatchupReport`
    now carries `our_team_external_id`/`opponent_team_external_id`. The
    JSON/HTML/dashboard key is now
    `our_team|opponent_team|format|session|player_id:opponent_id`, not
    just the two player ids. Added a dedicated regression test proving two
    real scopes with the same two players never collide
    (`TestPairKeyIsScopeSafe`), plus team ids are now visible in every
    export (JSON, HTML detail view, Excel "Our Team"/"Opponent Team"
    columns).
  - **P2 "selector is not coach-usable at division scale"** — redesigned
    both the standalone Player Matchup Engine HTML export and the Coach
    Dashboard into linked player-then-opponent dropdowns: choosing a
    player narrows the opponent list to only their real pairings, instead
    of one flat list of all 512 reports. Regression-tested
    (`test_choosing_a_player_narrows_the_opponent_options...`).
  - Renamed the Team Matchup Engine's "Opponent ranking (toughest real
    matchup first)" section to "Opponent Scouting," with the same
    experimental-quarantine framing as above.
- Adjustments made:
  - `model_source` was already shown beside evidence in every export
    (HTML, JSON, Excel) before this cycle -- confirmed still true, no
    change needed there.
  - Confirmed no numeric confidence score has been added anywhere,
    per your explicit "not until calibrated" instruction.
  - Added percentage number formatting to the Team Matchup Engine Excel
    ranking sheet (a real, if minor, pre-existing polish gap noticed while
    already in that file).
- Not yet addressed, honestly disclosed (not silently dropped):
  - **P2 lineup context in the dashboard** — the standalone Team Matchup
    Engine HTML/Excel already show lineup score and model basis per slot;
    the Coach Dashboard's own lineup table does not yet. Real gap.
  - **P2 charts / Captain's Edge summary** — still no plotted sparkline
    (a real one needs each player's full chronological skill-level series
    threaded through, which nothing here carries yet) and no dedicated
    "Captain's Edge card" (scope, coverage, lineup availability, data
    freshness) on the dashboard.
  - **Skill-level/evidence-tier/streak filters** on the selectors — not
    built this cycle.
  - **Recommended order item 5's "browser test of a checksum-verified live
    bundle"** — verified manually this cycle (rebuilt the real bundle
    against `data/apa_tracker.db`, confirmed the W-L records, scope-safe
    keys, and linked selector all work correctly via live screenshots, no
    console errors) but not yet automated into the pytest suite as a real
    browser-driven test.
  - Data Coverage view (§11) remains not-yet-started, as already noted.
- Clarifications: the "Direct Games" → "Direct Matches" and pooled-rate
  fixes are covered by the same `reconstruct_win_loss()` helper in
  `analytics/player_matchup_engine.py`, imported into
  `analytics/team_matchup_engine.py` rather than reimplemented, so the two
  engines can never quietly disagree on how a real win/loss record is
  derived from a stored rate. Full suite after all fixes: **1588 passed,
  0 failed** (the same one pre-existing, unrelated, already-broken test
  file from the prior entry remains excluded and untouched).

### Response to the follow-up audit (0741dd3) — 2026-09-16

Both real correctness findings from GPT's 09:05 UTC follow-up (logged
above) were confirmed against the actual code and fixed in commit
`450aba7`:

- **Fixes applied:**
  - **P2 "reconstructed W-L is not unconditionally exact"** — confirmed:
    `reconstruct_win_loss()`'s `round(rate * count)` is provably not exact
    for every real sample (e.g. a real 501-500 record rounds to
    `observed_win_rate 0.500`, which reconstructs as the wrong 500-501).
    Rather than bound or reject the ambiguous case, went further and
    removed the need to reconstruct anything at all: added
    `direct_wins`/`direct_losses` fields directly to
    `analytics.pairing_evidence.PairingEvidence`, counted exactly from the
    authoritative match rows at Stage 1 classification time (the same
    place `observed_win_rate` and `direct_evidence_count` already come
    from). `reconstruct_win_loss()` is deleted; both
    `player_matchup_engine.build_player_matchup_report()` and
    `team_matchup_engine._pooled_direct_record()` now read these exact
    integers straight off `PairingEvidence`, never re-derive them from a
    rate. Regression-tested with both a small exact case
    (`test_direct_wins_and_losses_are_counted_exactly_not_reconstructed`)
    and the literal 501-500/1001-match example GPT's own analysis
    identified as the failure mode
    (`test_a_large_sample_pools_exactly_not_via_rounded_rate_reconstruction`,
    `test_direct_wins_and_losses_pass_through_unreconstructed`).
  - **P2 "choices can still look identical across teams"** — confirmed:
    the linked opponent dropdown's label was `"Name (format, session)"`
    with no team, so a same-named opponent player on two teams during
    simultaneous roster membership could display identically even though
    the underlying scope-safe key never collided. Added
    `opponent_team_name` to `PlayerMatchupReport` (threaded through from
    the real scope already available in
    `scripts/build_coach_advantage_bundle.py`) and included it in the
    dropdown label (`"Name — Team (format, session)"`); falls back to the
    team's real external id if no name was supplied, so the label is
    never silently ambiguous even in a caller that doesn't have a display
    name handy. Regression-tested
    (`test_the_opponent_team_name_disambiguates_a_same_named_opponent`).
  - **Documentation** — corrected `analytics/team_matchup_engine.py`'s
    module docstring, which still claimed "recomputes no probability" /
    "the real, validated signal" despite the module's own "Explicitly
    experimental" section admitting
    `reliability_weighted_skill_probability` is a real, unvalidated
    recomputation. The introductory paragraphs now name that one
    exception explicitly and point to the experimental section instead of
    contradicting it.
- **Not yet addressed, honestly disclosed (unchanged from the prior
  entry):** dashboard lineup context, plotted sparklines, Captain's Edge
  card, skill/streak filters, and an automated browser-driven regression
  test of a live bundle (still verified manually, not in pytest).
### Response to the follow-up fixes and dashboard review (29df5c8) — 2026-09-16

Confirmed GPT's P2 finding against the actual code before fixing it, in
commit `2592b79`:

- **P2 "lineup score/source mismatch" — fixed.** Verified in
  `analytics/lineup_lab.py`: `pairing_score()`'s own docstring says
  outright that DIRECT history "does not influence lineup selection," and
  `lineup_score_source` is hardcoded to
  `"analytics.head_to_head:validated-skill-only"` for every slot,
  including DIRECT ones. `ui/dashboard.py`'s lineup table rendered
  `slot.lineup_score` next to a "Model basis" column populated from
  `slot.model_source` — for a DIRECT slot, that could show
  `"analytics.head_to_head:direct-history-and-skill"` right beside a score
  that was never actually computed that way. Fixed by rendering
  `slot.lineup_score_source` under a renamed "Score basis" column, and
  moving `model_source` into a separate "Direct evidence" column with the
  observed rate/count — both real numbers stay visible, just no longer
  implying one produced the other. Regression-tested at both layers per
  the specific suggestion to add a DIRECT-slot case where the two sources
  differ: a Python-side fixture in `tests/test_dashboard.py`, and a real
  headless-Chromium check in `tests/test_dashboard_browser.py` that finds
  an actual DIRECT lineup slot in a live-built bundle and asserts the page
  shows its real `lineup_score_source`.
- **"Add filter membership assertions"** — added a browser test that picks
  a real, achievable skill-level threshold from the live embedded data
  (not an arbitrary guess) and asserts every opponent option remaining
  after the filter genuinely has skill level at or above it.
- **Not addressed this cycle, honestly disclosed:** SVG point-value
  assertions, a scoped retained-live-bundle check, reading count/date
  context on sparklines, data freshness in the Captain's Edge card, and a
  genuine win/loss streak metric distinct from skill-level trend
  direction. These are real, disclosed gaps, not silently dropped —
  several (data freshness, W-L streaks) need new fields this project does
  not currently track and would need real evidence-layer work, not a
  quick addition, before they could ship without inventing something.
