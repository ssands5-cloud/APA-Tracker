# Overnight Coach Advantage Report

## Claude Build Notes
Date: 2026-09-16

- Implemented: `analytics/player_matchup_engine.py` and
  `analytics/team_matchup_engine.py` (Coach Mode aggregators over
  already-validated evidence); HTML/Excel/JSON exports for both
  (`ui/export_html_player_matchup_engine.py`,
  `ui/export_html_team_matchup_engine.py`,
  `ui/export_excel_player_matchup_engine.py`,
  `ui/export_excel_team_matchup_engine.py`,
  `ui/export_json_coach_advantage.py`); `ui/dashboard.py` (replaces
  `ui/dashboard_stub.py`, deleted) — a static page combining Player vs
  Player, Team vs Team, and the whole-division Opponent Risk Profile
  ranking; `scripts/build_coach_advantage_bundle.py` (preflight → acquire
  → compute → render → verify → finalize, manifest + checksums + READY);
  README "Coach Advantage Tools" section; 9 new test files.
- Verified: full suite **1577 passed, 0 failed** (one pre-existing,
  unrelated, already-broken test file excluded — see Observations). CI
  green on Python 3.12 and 3.13. Data source: the real, repaired
  `data/apa_tracker.db` (GraphQL-sourced live sync, read-only, no
  rescrape) via `python scripts/build_coach_advantage_bundle.py --db
  data/apa_tracker.db --our-team-id 13082948` — 8 real scheduled
  opponents, all 8 scopes usable, 512 real player-pairing reports. The
  "Margin of Error" scope independently reproduced the exact 4 DIRECT / 60
  INDIRECT / 0 UNKNOWN / 64 total already established earlier this
  session. Visually verified in a browser (screenshots): both selectors,
  roster/trend tables, opponent ranking, and approved lineup all render
  real data correctly, no console errors.
- Bugs fixed: (1) dark-mode legibility bug — the three new HTML templates
  had no explicit `body` background, unreadable in a dark browser theme;
  (2) an Excel sheet-title truncation bug that could chop `"Lineup"` down
  to an unrecognizable `"Lin"` when a scope name was long; (3) a related
  duplicate-sheet-title collision that openpyxl silently renamed, pushing
  a title back over Excel's 31-character limit; (4) a Windows-only
  test-isolation bug — my own test fixture rebuilding the *shared*
  `data/demo_coherent.db` file could leave it open long enough to block a
  different test module's own rebuild of that same path. All four are now
  covered by dedicated regression tests.
- Caveats: Option A path only, as directed — no new win-probability or
  confidence model, no categorical "danger player"/"favored" flag, no
  verdict text ("Player A is favored because…"). Every new export has a
  test asserting that language never appears. Matches
  `docs/captain_first_edge_experience.md` §13's exclusion table. Also not
  built yet: a plotted sparkline (trend shown as a direction + volatility
  indicator only — a real chart needs the full per-player skill-level
  series, a disclosed follow-up); skill/streak filters on the dashboard;
  the Data Coverage view (§11, already "not yet started" before this
  work).
- Observations: found (but did not touch, revert, or commit) a
  substantial pre-existing **uncommitted** change already in the working
  tree — `ui/export_html_player_vs_player.py` and four related files —
  that currently breaks `tests/test_player_vs_player_unified_tab.py`'s
  collection; excluded via `--ignore` from every test run above, and
  flagged for separate attention since it looks like real unfinished work
  predating this session. Also verified via `gh api
  repos/ssands5-cloud/APA-Tracker/collaborators` that `ssands5-cloud` is
  the repo's only collaborator — there is no live GPT actor that can
  audit this repo autonomously overnight, so the section below is a real,
  unfilled placeholder.
